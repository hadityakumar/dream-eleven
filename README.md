# **Innovative Solution for Inter IIIT Tech Meet 13.0**

This project was developed as a solution to a complex and competitive problem statement presented at **Inter IIIT Tech Meet 13.0**. The challenge involved creating a comprehensive system to **predict cricket player performances** and recommend **winning fantasy cricket teams** for Dream11. This solution had to consider a multitude of factors, including historical player data, match contexts, and team strategies, all while delivering reliable, real-time outputs.

## **Problem Statement**

The problem required:
1. **Player Performance Prediction**: Develop a system to accurately predict cricket players' performances for upcoming matches based on historical data and contextual variables like venue, pitch, and weather conditions.
2. **Fantasy Team Optimization**: Recommend the best possible team composition adhering to Dream11 constraints.
3. **Data Challenges**: Handle edge cases such as retired players, future matches with unknown variables, and missing or incomplete data.

We tackled this problem using a **full-stack solution** powered by **state-of-the-art machine learning** and robust web technologies.
