# **Innovative Solution for Inter IIT Tech Meet 13.0**

This project was developed as a solution to a complex and competitive problem statement presented at **Inter IIT Tech Meet 13.0**. The challenge involved creating a comprehensive system to **predict cricket player performances** and recommend **winning fantasy cricket teams** for Dream11. This solution had to consider a multitude of factors, including historical player data, match contexts, and team strategies, all while delivering reliable, real-time outputs.

Deployed at [Edge11](https://dream-eleven-gold.vercel.app/)

## **Problem Statement**

The problem required:
1. **Player Performance Prediction**: Develop a system to accurately predict cricket players' performances for upcoming matches based on historical data and contextual variables like venue, pitch, and weather conditions.
2. **Fantasy Team Optimization**: Recommend the best possible team composition adhering to Dream11 constraints.
3. **Data Challenges**: Handle edge cases such as retired players, future matches with unknown variables, and missing or incomplete data.

We tackled this problem using a **full-stack solution** powered by **state-of-the-art machine learning** and robust web technologies.

## üé® Frontend  
The frontend was developed using **Next.js** for its server-side rendering capabilities and enhanced performance. **Tailwind CSS** was utilized to achieve a clean, responsive, and user-friendly design. The interface provides:  
- Interactive inputs for match details and player preferences.  
- Visualizations of predicted scores and optimal team configurations.  
- Chatbot integration for user queries.  

---

## üîß Backend  
The backend is implemented with **Node.js**, handling data preprocessing and interactions between the user interface and machine learning models. APIs are optimized for low-latency responses, ensuring smooth user experiences during real-time interactions.

---

## ü§ñ Machine Learning  
Our **XGBoost**-based model was meticulously crafted to predict player performances. Key highlights include:  
- **Dataset**: Trained on **CricSheet ball-by-ball data** spanning 2001‚Äì2024.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Incorporated metrics like venue, pitch, weather, and player momentum.  
- **Experiments**: Tested advanced models like **Neural Networks**, **LightGBM**, **CatBoost**, and **N-BEATS**, but XGBoost consistently outperformed others.  
- **Challenges**:  
  - Handling **retired players** and ensuring accurate predictions for their historical performance.  
  - Managing **future dates** effectively to avoid data leakage.

---

## üß† Chatbot  
To enhance usability, a **chatbot powered by OpenAI API** was integrated, allowing users to query the rationale behind player selections. For example:  
> *"Why was MS Dhoni chosen for this match?"*  
The chatbot explains player selection based on recent form, historical performance, and contextual match factors.
