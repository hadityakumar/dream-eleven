## üé® Frontend  
The frontend was developed using **Next.js** for its server-side rendering capabilities and enhanced performance. **Tailwind CSS** was utilized to achieve a clean, responsive, and user-friendly design. The interface provides:  
- Interactive inputs for match details and player preferences.  
- Visualizations of predicted scores and optimal team configurations.  
- Chatbot integration for user queries.  

---

## üîß Backend  
The backend is implemented with **Node.js**, handling data preprocessing and interactions between the user interface and machine learning models. APIs are optimized for low-latency responses, ensuring smooth user experiences during real-time interactions.

## ü§ñ Machine Learning  
Our **XGBoost**-based model was meticulously crafted to predict player performances. Key highlights include:  
- **Dataset**: Trained on **CricSheet ball-by-ball data** spanning 2001‚Äì2024.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Incorporated metrics like venue, pitch, weather, and player momentum.  
- **Experiments**: Tested advanced models like **Neural Networks**, **LightGBM**, **CatBoost**, and **N-BEATS**, but XGBoost consistently outperformed others.  
- **Challenges**:  
  - Handling **retired players** and ensuring accurate predictions for their historical performance.  
  - Managing **future dates** effectively to avoid data leakage.

## üß† Chatbot  
To enhance usability, a **chatbot powered by OpenAI API** was integrated, allowing users to query the rationale behind player selections. For example:  
> *"Why was MS Dhoni chosen for this match?"*  
The chatbot explains player selection based on recent form, historical performance, and contextual match factors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Challenges Overcome  
- **Data Quality**: Cleaning and merging inconsistent historical datasets.  
- **Feature Creation**: Extracting actionable insights from raw data.  
- **Model Generalization**: Ensuring predictions remain reliable across varied match scenarios.
